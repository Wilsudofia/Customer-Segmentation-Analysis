### Project Overview

This project applied customer segmentation techniques to a retail transaction dataset containing over 500,000 records. Using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** framework, we quantified customer engagement and value, then applied **KMeans clustering** to group customers into meaningful segments. The analysis produced **four distinct customer groups**: VIP customers, loyal regulars, regular active customers, and at-risk customers.

These segments provide actionable insights to support **targeted marketing, customer retention, and personalized engagement strategies**, enabling the business to optimize resources and increase return on investment.
